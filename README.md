# ðŸ”— LangChain Playground

Welcome to the **LangChain Playground** â€” a personal repository to explore, learn, and build with [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), a powerful framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).

This repo documents my journey with LangChain: exploring its concepts, experimenting with different modules, and integrating external tools and APIs.

## ðŸ§  About LangChain

LangChain is a framework designed to simplify the development of applications that leverage large language models (LLMs). It enables:

- Prompt engineering with reusable templates
- Chaining of multiple LLM calls
- Memory for contextual conversations
- Integration with APIs, tools, and file systems
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using vector stores

This repository is a sandbox to understand and experiment with these building blocks.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/langchain-playground.git
cd langchain-playground
````

### 2. Set up the environment

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set up environment variables:

Create a `.env` file by copying `.env.example` and add your API keys:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
# Add others like SERPAPI_KEY, PINECONE_API_KEY, etc.
```

## ðŸ’¡ Concepts & Experiments

This repo covers core LangChain concepts via hands-on scripts and notebooks:

* **Prompt Templates**: Structured and reusable prompt formats
* **Chains**: Connecting LLM calls with logic and flow
* **Memory**: Retaining context in multi-turn interactions
* **Agents & Tools**: Giving LLMs the ability to act and make decisions
* **Vector Stores**: Efficient retrieval from unstructured data (FAISS, Pinecone, etc.)
* **Callbacks & Debugging**: Tracking what's happening under the hood

---

## ðŸ§© Dependencies

Key packages include:

* `langchain`
* `openai`
* `python-dotenv`
* `tqdm`
* `faiss-cpu` / `pinecone-client`
* `streamlit` (for UI experiments)

Full list available in `requirements.txt`.
